          Okay, okay, I love dogs.
          <br>
          But who am I, anyway?
        </h1>
        <p>
          I'm Matt Freeman, a positive reinforcement dog-trainer-in-training based in Burnaby, BC. I launched More Dogs
          after a 7+ year career as a copywriter which left me feeling dissatisfied and computer-bound, aiming instead
          to provide a service that could bring people and animals closer together. Basically, I realized, at some
          point, that (probably like you) whatever part of your brain pumps endorphins into your system when you
          interact with dogs is comically overactive in me, and figured I might as well put it to work doing some small
          good in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you'll allow me to get heady for a sec, my philosophy involves treating dogs as agents with their own
          unique subjectivities, as actors in the world that make decisions and deserve the same access to joy,
          compassion, and care as the rest of us. This is one reason I'm absolutely adamant about using positive
          reinforcement methods only in my practice--the other being that the data shows that they just work better than
          aversive techniques. I'm also just obsessed with the rich contingencies that arise amid human-nonhuman
          interactions, and a student of behaviour for both humans and their canine friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          My dog Luigi is a 5-year old Bernese Husky mix that I raised from eight weeks, born with a vortex of
          eternal-puppy energy and a fair amount of kid- and dog-reactivity, so I know how anxiety-inducing it can be
          when your dog isn't acting to others in the sweet way they act with you. I'm an ongoing mentee of the folks at
          DogPartners up in North Van, I'm PetSafe First-Aid Certified, and am currently enrolled in Michael Shikashio's
          Masters in Dog Aggression course. I also volunteer working with the dogs at New West Animal Services and Delta
          Community Animal Shelter. I'm passionate about education and mastering my craft, and doing everything I can to
          become the absolute best dog trainer and walker I can be.
